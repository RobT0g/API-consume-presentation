run "npm init on" terminal
add "type":"module" on package.json (demanded for imports, but you can also just use require)
run "npm i --save axios" on terminal
create main.js (name does not really matter, but it is a good practice to create and set the main file on the package.json)
add "import axios from 'axios'" or "const axios = require('axios')"
have fun =)
